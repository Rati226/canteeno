    <p>Choosing healthy food from the canteen<BR>
    Here are some healthy canteen options and ideas. If they’re available at your COLLEGE canteen, these are the options to go for.
    
    <P><b>Sandwiches, rolls and wraps</b></P>
    Encourage your child to choose a multigrain, wholemeal or high-fibre white sandwich, roll or wrap. Healthy fillings include salad and lean chicken or beef, fish, eggs or lentil patties.
    
    <P><b>Cold Food</b></P>
    Your canteen might serve fresh salads, sushi or rice paper rolls – yum!</p>
